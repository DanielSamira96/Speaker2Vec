# Speaker2Vec

## Overview

This study presents "Speaker2Vec", a Natural Language Processing (NLP) methodology for vectorizing speaker features in online forums. The project addresses the gap in user representation in digital discourse analysis.
This approach, relevant to our NLP course, demonstrates the practical application of course concepts in analyzing and understanding complex communication patterns online, showcasing the potential of combining diverse NLP techniques to enhance discourse analysis.
The results of our evaluation demonstrate that Speaker2Vec successfully captures and quantifies the nuances of user engagement and communication styles, validating its effectiveness in the targeted task.
